Build a web service (e.g. one that responds with JSON) in Ruby or Javascript to convert arbitrary text so that it contains only 1 space after a period between sentences. The response should contain the converted text along with meta data describing the corrections made.

Then, build a web based front-end that will submit arbitrary text to this service via AJAX and show the result. Additionally, the rendered result should include a visual representation of where corrections were made in the text.

Accuracy of the conversion isn't necessarily important (i.e. don't worry about what is and is not a sentence), instead you will be judged on the following criteria:
Clarity and conciseness of code
Ruby / Javascript best practices
HTTP best practices
Handling of edge cases
Start by building the web service component of the system and then get as far as you can with the front-end piece. Don't worry if you can't finish it.
